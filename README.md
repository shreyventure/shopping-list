# Shopping-List

Shopping-List is not an ordinary todo-list. It utilizes crud functionalities to provide creation, deletion, etc. These functionalities, however, are dynamic, nimble and happen in real-time for the users sharing the list, all thanks to socket-io.

The main object of this project is to make users have access to a shared shopping-list. A user makes changes to it, while the others see it happening.

Below images portray some examples of using shopping-list.
